# HERMES-TEAM ☤

HERMES-TEAM is a portable, public distribution that keeps Hermes as the control plane and uses
health-gated adapters for execution. OpenCode with dynamically discovered free
models is the default candidate. Codex, Grok, OpenRouter, local
OpenAI-compatible endpoints, and generic CLIs are optional adapters.

## Release identity

| Layer | Version |
|---|---|
| Hermes distribution family | `0.1.5` |
| Hermes Agent engine | `0.18.0` |

HERMES-CONTROL must use the same distribution version while retaining the separate engine version.

## Install HERMES-TEAM

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JUNJOONHWAN/HERMES-TEAM.git
cd HERMES-TEAM
python3 -m pip install -e .
hermes setup
python3 scripts/setup_public_edition.py
```

This bootstraps the public Role Shell, adapter, Timeline/Code Map, NeuralLink,
Kanban, and three-layer Heartbeat contracts on top of Hermes.

Start here:

- [Korean quick start](docs/PUBLIC_EDITION_QUICKSTART_KO.md)
- [Architecture implementation report](HERMES_PUBLIC_ARCHITECTURE_REPORT_KO.md)
- [AI operations manual](AI_OPERATIONS_MANUAL.md)
- [Adapter templates](distribution/adapters/README.md)
- [Optional market memory](distribution/market/README.md)
- [Upstream upgrade contract](docs/HERMES_TEAM_UPGRADE_KO.md)
- [Validation and exact exclusions](distribution/validation/README.md)

HERMES-TEAM includes Role Shells, Bindings, scoped Overrides, Receipt
gates, Kanban dispatch, Timeline/Code Map/NeuralLink/Roadmap, and a three-layer
Heartbeat. It includes no operator-specific database, absolute home path,
private MCP requirement, or private service/cron inventory.

The upstream Python package name, CLI name, configuration paths, and
`~/.hermes/hermes-agent` installation layout intentionally remain unchanged so
upstream Hermes releases can be integrated without a private compatibility
fork.

## Upstream Hermes Agent

## HERMES-TEAM control layer

This distribution adds a native project and card control plane above Hermes'
execution adapters:

- **Project/Card Manager:** long-running work is grouped by stable `p_*`
  Project IDs while every executable unit keeps its immutable `t_*` card ID.
  Telegram notifications and the Kanban UI show both IDs.
- **Role Shell adapters:** the controller owns the project graph; replaceable
  code, browser, market, operations, report, verification, and tool-management
  workers execute cards without acquiring project-manager authority.
- **Hard code-card approval gate:** proposing a code card creates only a
  durable `pa_*` approval request and puts the Project in `paused`. No Kanban
  task exists, and nothing can dispatch, until an operator approves it from
  Telegram or the web UI.
- **Separate Project DB:** milestone, phase, card counts, pending approvals,
  repository identity, commit SHA, push receipt, and Git events survive apart
  from the Kanban execution ledger.
- **Governed Git lifecycle:** project creation can use an existing repository,
  initialize local Git, or create a private/public GitHub repository. Card
  work is committed on isolated branches; workers cannot push `main` or
  `master` directly.
- **Replay-safe notifications:** new subscriptions begin at the current event
  cursor, archived recovery predecessors are silent, and historical failures
  are not replayed as a Telegram alert storm.

See the [Korean supervisor operations guide](docs/HERMES_SUPERVISOR_OPERATIONS_KO.md)
for the operating contract and examples.

**The self-improving AI agent built by [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com).** It's the only agent with a built-in learning loop — it creates skills from experience, improves them during use, nudges itself to persist knowledge, searches its own past conversations, and builds a deepening model of who you are across sessions. Run it on a $5 VPS, a GPU cluster, or serverless infrastructure that costs nearly nothing when idle. It's not tied to your laptop — talk to it from Telegram while it works on a cloud VM.

Use any model you want — [Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com), OpenRouter, OpenAI, your own endpoint, and [many others](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/integrations/providers). Switch with `hermes model` — no code changes, no lock-in.

## Upstream base Hermes installation

The commands below install upstream Hermes only. Use the HERMES-TEAM install
above to add this distribution's governance, memory, and adapter layers.

### Linux, macOS, WSL2, Termux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows (native, PowerShell)

> **Heads up:** Native Windows runs Hermes without WSL — CLI, gateway, TUI, and tools all work natively. If you'd rather use WSL2, the Linux/macOS one-liner above works there too. Found a bug? Please [file issues](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues).

Run this in PowerShell:

```powershell
iex (irm https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.ps1)
```

The installer handles everything: uv, Python 3.11, Node.js, ripgrep, ffmpeg, **and a portable Git Bash** (MinGit, unpacked to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\git` — no admin required, completely isolated from any system Git install). Hermes uses this bundled Git Bash to run shell commands.

If you already have Git installed, the installer detects it and uses that instead. Otherwise a ~45MB MinGit download is all you need — it won't touch or interfere with any system Git.

> **Android / Termux:** The tested manual path is documented in the [Termux guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/termux). On Termux, Hermes installs a curated `.[termux]` extra because the full `.[all]` extra currently pulls Android-incompatible voice dependencies.
>
> **Windows:** Native Windows is fully supported — the PowerShell one-liner above installs everything. If you'd rather use WSL2, the Linux command works there too. Native Windows install lives under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes`; WSL2 installs under `~/.hermes` as on Linux.

After installation:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc    # reload shell (or: source ~/.zshrc)
hermes              # start chatting!
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Windows Defender or antivirus flags `uv.exe` as malware

If your antivirus (Bitdefender, Windows Defender, etc.) quarantines `uv.exe` from the Hermes `bin` folder (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\bin\uv.exe`), this is a **false positive**. The file is Astral's `uv` — the Rust Python package manager Hermes bundles to manage its Python environment. ML-based antivirus engines commonly flag unsigned Rust binaries that download and install packages.

**To verify your copy is authentic:**

```powershell
# Install GitHub CLI if needed
winget install --id GitHub.cli

# Login to GitHub
gh auth login

# Run verification
$uv = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\hermes\bin\uv.exe"
$ver = (& $uv --version).Split(' ')[1]
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
$zip = "$env:TEMP\uv.zip"
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/download/$ver/uv-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip" -OutFile $zip -UseBasicParsing
gh attestation verify $zip --repo astral-sh/uv
Expand-Archive $zip "$env:TEMP\uv_x" -Force
(Get-FileHash "$env:TEMP\uv_x\uv.exe").Hash -eq (Get-FileHash $uv).Hash
```

If attestation says "Verification succeeded" and the last line prints `True`, you're good.

**To whitelist Hermes:**
- **Windows Defender:** Run PowerShell as Admin → `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\hermes\bin"`
- **Bitdefender:** Add an exception in the Bitdefender console (Protection > Antivirus > Settings > Manage Exceptions)
- Whitelist the **folder**, not the file hash — Hermes updates `uv` and the hash changes every version

For more context, see the upstream Astral reports: [astral-sh/uv#13553](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/13553), [astral-sh/uv#15011](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/15011), [astral-sh/uv#10079](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/10079).

## Getting Started

```bash
hermes              # Interactive CLI — start a conversation
hermes model        # Choose your LLM provider and model
hermes tools        # Configure which tools are enabled
hermes config set   # Set individual config values
hermes gateway      # Start the messaging gateway (Telegram, Discord, etc.)
hermes setup        # Run the full setup wizard (configures everything at once)
hermes claw migrate # Migrate from OpenClaw (if coming from OpenClaw)
hermes update       # Update to the latest version
hermes doctor       # Diagnose any issues
```

### Web dashboard and Kanban

```bash
hermes dashboard
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:9119/kanban` for the built-in Kanban board. The web UI
supports drag-and-drop columns, cards, comments, attachments, run logs,
multiple boards, diagnostics, assignees, and orchestration settings. The
dashboard binds to localhost by default.

When Hermes runs on a remote host, keep that default and forward the port:

```bash
ssh -L 9119:127.0.0.1:9119 user@remote-host
```

## Skip the API-key collection — Nous Portal

Hermes works with whatever provider you want — that's not changing. But if you'd rather not collect five separate API keys for the model, web search, image generation, TTS, and a cloud browser, **[Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com)** covers all of them under one subscription:

- **300+ models** — pick any of them with `/model <name>`
- **Tool Gateway** — web search (Firecrawl), image generation (FAL), text-to-speech (OpenAI), cloud browser (Browser Use), all routed through your sub. No extra accounts.

One command from a fresh install:

```bash
hermes setup --portal
```

That logs you in via OAuth, sets Nous as your provider, and turns on the Tool Gateway. Check what's wired up any time with `hermes portal info`. Full details on the [Tool Gateway docs page](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/tool-gateway).

You can still bring your own keys per-tool whenever you want — the gateway is per-backend, not all-or-nothing.

---

## CLI vs Messaging Quick Reference

Hermes has two entry points: start the terminal UI with `hermes`, or run the gateway and talk to it from Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, or Email. Once you're in a conversation, many slash commands are shared across both interfaces.

| Action                         | CLI                                           | Messaging platforms                                                              |

| Start fresh conversation       | `/new` or `/reset`                            | `/new` or `/reset`                                                               |
| Change model                   | `/model [provider:model]`                     | `/model [provider:model]`                                                        |
| Set a personality              | `/personality [name]`                         | `/personality [name]`                                                            |
| Retry or undo the last turn    | `/retry`, `/undo`                             | `/retry`, `/undo`                                                                |
| Compress context / check usage | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [--days N]` | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [days]`                                        |
| Browse skills                  | `/skills` or `/<skill-name>`                  | `/<skill-name>`                                                                  |
| Interrupt current work         | `Ctrl+C` or send a new message                | `/stop` or send a new message                                                    |
| Platform-specific status       | `/platforms`                                  | `/status`, `/sethome`                                                            |

## Migrating from OpenClaw

If you're coming from OpenClaw, Hermes can automatically import your settings, memories, skills, and API keys.

**During first-time setup:** The setup wizard (`hermes setup`) automatically detects `~/.openclaw` and offers to migrate before configuration begins.

**Anytime after install:**

```bash
hermes claw migrate              # Interactive migration (full preset)
hermes claw migrate --dry-run    # Preview what would be migrated
hermes claw migrate --preset user-data   # Migrate without secrets
hermes claw migrate --overwrite  # Overwrite existing conflicts
```

What gets imported:

- **SOUL.md** — persona file
- **Memories** — MEMORY.md and USER.md entries
- **Skills** — user-created skills → `~/.hermes/skills/openclaw-imports/`
- **Command allowlist** — approval patterns
- **Messaging settings** — platform configs, allowed users, working directory
- **API keys** — allowlisted secrets (Telegram, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs)
- **TTS assets** — workspace audio files
- **Workspace instructions** — AGENTS.md (with `--workspace-target`)

See `hermes claw migrate --help` for all options, or use the `openclaw-migration` skill for an interactive agent-guided migration with dry-run previews.

---

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! See the [Contributing Guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/developer-guide/contributing) for development setup, code style, and PR process.

Quick start for contributors — use the standard installer, then work from the
full git checkout it creates at `$HERMES_HOME/hermes-agent` (usually
`~/.hermes/hermes-agent`). This matches the layout used by `hermes update`, the
managed venv, lazy dependencies, gateway, and docs tooling.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.sh | bash
cd "${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}/hermes-agent"
uv pip install -e ".[all,dev]"
scripts/run_tests.sh
```

HERMES-TEAM's public-core completion gate is stricter about documenting its
narrow optional/upstream-baseline exclusions:

```bash
scripts/run_tests.sh -j 8 \
  --exclude-manifest distribution/validation/test_exclusions.json
```

Manual clone fallback (for throwaway clones/CI where you intentionally do not
want the managed install layout):

Create the venv outside the cloned source tree — a venv inside the directory
the agent operates from can be wiped by a relative-path command the agent runs
against its own checkout, destroying the running runtime mid-session.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv venv ~/.hermes/venvs/hermes-dev --python 3.11
source ~/.hermes/venvs/hermes-dev/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[all,dev]"
scripts/run_tests.sh
```
